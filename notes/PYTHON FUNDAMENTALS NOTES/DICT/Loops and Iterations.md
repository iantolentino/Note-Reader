### Iterations
- is when the same procedure is repeated over and over again
### Loops
- are used to return the same lines of code several times [...] until a condition is met
## 2 Types of Iterations loops

### "for" loops for 
- this repeats a sequence until the condition is satisfied.
- a sequence can be a list, tuple, dictionary set, or string.
- loop a set number of times
### Continue statements
- skips the value of the variable and proceed with the rest of the items in the list
- used when the continue statement is hit, the current iterations stops and goes back to the top of the loop
### Break statements
- stops the loop
- to break out of loop at any point in time
### Range functions range()
- provides a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending at a number you specify
- the code is then looped through that many numbers of times
- is a function used to generate a series of numbers
### Nested Keyword
- a nested keyword is a loop within a loop
- the inner loop must always finish running before the outer loop can continue
### "while loops" while
- these are used to iterate statements until it becomes false
- use when you need to loop based on a condition rather than counting
